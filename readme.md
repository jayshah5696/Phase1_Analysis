# Phase 1 Analysis of Multivariate Quality Control Data for an Industrial Forging Process     


The project is based on a set of data collected from a manufacturing process, in which both in-control and out-of-control data are present. You are asked to develop a method or a procedure to identify the data falling in the respective categories, i.e., which ones are in-control and which ones out of control. This is amounted to a Phase I analysis, whose purpose to isolate the in-control data for estimating the in-control distribution parameters so that a monitoring scheme can be set up for future missions.

## Description of the dataset
1. This is a manufacturing related dataset, and it has a total of 552 data records.
2. Each row is a data record. Each data record contains 209 values.
2. The physical meaning of each value is omitted.


## Results

-  Performed principal component analysis on multivariate high dimensional data set to achieve data reduction and obtained vital few principal component that encapsulated most variance (82.18%).
- Applied T2 and M-Cusum charts in Minitab to carry out the process of cleansing the data by systematically removing both points and sustained changes to obtain clean in-control data in-accordance with preset industrial standards and to cluster them into two distinct categories: In control and Out of control data points.
- Estimated distribution parameters from within control data point to use it as monitoring scheme for future quality control missions (Phase 2 Analysis).
- Identified two distinct mean shifts and feature variables attributed external causes and proposed further future analysis approach to implement process improvement strategies.
